# Exercise 4

## Tasks

1. Explain how you'd approach implementing the remaining classes that touch the infrastructure.

2. Carry on with the implementation.

## Teacher's solution

1. Implement session based `DecodingBoards`.

    Behaviour to implement:

    * defined by the [`DecodingBoards`](../src/Game/DecodingBoards.php) interface

    For the session storage implementation plase use Symfony's implementation (`Session` and `SessionInterface`).

2. Implement the `CodeMaker`.

    Behaviour to implement:

    * defined by the [`CodeMaker`](../src/Game/CodeMaker.php) interface - should return a random code of given length

3. Provide `CodeMaker` and `DecodingBoards` in-memory implementations to be used in tests.
